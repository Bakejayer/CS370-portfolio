# CS370-portfolio
For this project, we were tasked with creating an algorithm that allows an intelligent agent to solve a maze. We were given most of the code in the notebook and two helper classes, as well as pseudocode to assist us in the construction of the algorithm. I created the code that allows the agent to train itself. This course was interesting as it sheds light on systems that people use almost everyday but have very little working knowledge of. As a computer scientist, it is beneficial to become knowledgable on these topic not only so that we can solve new problems and implement new solutions, but also so we can educate people around us on how these systems work and how they can keep themselves safe while using them. Tackling a new problem includes educating myself on it and what technologies are used to solve them, then attempting implementations until I find one that works. I believe we as ethical computer scientists have a duty to both the end user and the organization to create software that exposes both parties to as little risk as possible. Data collection should be thought about thouroghly to ensure that only necessary data is collecte and that the user is aware of it and consents to it.
